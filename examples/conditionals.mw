# Conditional comparison example

# Example 1: Greater Than
# Check if 5 is greater than 3
5 climb;
3 climb;
tower whiskers "5 is greater than 3" meow tail;

# Example 2: Less Than
# Check if 3 is less than 5
3 climb;
5 climb;
crouch whiskers "3 is less than 5" meow tail;

# Example 3: Equals
# Check if 5 is equal to 5
5 climb;
5 climb;
sniff whiskers "5 is equal to 5" meow tail;

# Example 4: Not Equal (using a combination of sniff and whiskers)
# Check if 5 is not equal to 3
5 climb;
3 climb;
sniff whiskers "5 is equal to 3 (this should not print)" meow tail;
# To express "not equal", you would typically use a combination of sniff and then
# an inverted logic or a separate command if available.
# For now, we'll just show the equality check.
