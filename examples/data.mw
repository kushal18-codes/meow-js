# Data structure storage example

# Store a list of items at key "myList"
"item1" climb "item2" climb "item3" climb "myList" litter;

# Retrieve the list and print its contents
"myList" box;
fall meow; # Output: item3
fall meow; # Output: item2
fall meow; # Output: item1

# Store a key-value pair (dictionary-like) at key "myDict"
"valueA" climb "keyA" climb "valueB" climb "keyB" climb "myDict" litter;

# Retrieve the dictionary and demonstrate accessing values (conceptual, as direct key access isn't shown)
"myDict" box;
fall meow; # Output: keyB
fall meow; # Output: valueB
fall meow; # Output: keyA
fall meow; # Output: valueA
